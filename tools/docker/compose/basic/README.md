# Locally deploy Pydio Cells in no time!

This sample configuration helps you to run a Cells server in sandbox mode with docker compose.

On your workstation, simply:

- Run `docker compose up -d`.
- Open a browser at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)
- Accept the self-signed certificate
- Log in with admin / admin
- Start to explore

For convenience, we also left as comments a sample pattern to use one of the 4 supported DB server type.  
See [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.
