1) Using Bash

On Linux, you must insure the 'bash-completion' library is installed:
	
	on Debian / Ubuntu
		sudo apt install bash-completion

	on RHEL / CentOS
		sudo yum install bash-completion

	on MacOS (make sure to follow the instructions displayed on Homebrew)
		brew install bash-completion

Then, to enable completion in your current session:
	source <(` + os.Args[0] + ` completion bash)

Or persistently:
	Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS
		` + os.Args[0] + ` completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/cells

	macOS
		` + os.Args[0] + ` completion bash | tee /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/cells

2) Using Zsh

	Add to current zsh session:
		source <(` + os.Args[0] + ` completion zsh)

	Add persistently:
		` + os.Args[0] + ` completion zsh | sudo tee <path>/<to>/<your-zsh-completion-folder>
	
	On macOS
		` + os.Args[0] + ` completion zsh | tee /Users/<your current user>/.zsh/completion/_cells
